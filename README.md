Welcome to my GitHub page! My name is Milad, and I am excited to embark on a new journey as a **data scientist**. While my background is in *digital marketing*, I have recently acquired skills in **Python** programming and am currently in the process of learning data science and machine learning.

My journey into the world of **data science** began with a realization of the immense value that data could bring to businesses. I recognized the potential of leveraging data to make informed decisions and drive business growth. This realization led me to dive headfirst into the world of data science, where I have been developing my skills and exploring new technologies.

My experience in *digital marketing* has given me a unique perspective on the role of data in business, and I am eager to apply this perspective to my work in data science. I am currently learning the fundamentals of data science and machine learning and am excited to apply these skills to real-world business problems.

I am passionate about building a new network in the **data science community** and collaborating with others to tackle challenging problems. I am eager to contribute to open-source projects and share my work on GitHub. I am committed to continuous learning and growth and am excited about the endless possibilities that data science and machine learning offer.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub page, and I look forward to connecting with you!
